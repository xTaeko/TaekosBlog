Hey, I'm Taeko and I'm 24 years old. After I first started playing games, I always imagined how it all works together, how fascinating it would be to be part of all this. 
So, I started with Computer Sciences and... Let's say Computer Sciences and I have a complicated relationship.
 
After finishing my bachelor's degree at the TU Dortmund, I started my master degree in "Visual Computing and Games Technology" 
at the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. 

While fighting with Unity I decided to make a blog with tutorials to help other people who face the same problems as I did.
